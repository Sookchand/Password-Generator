## Tech Stack
The tech stack used in this Python code is the Python Standard Library. The Python Standard Library provides a wide range of modules and functions for rapid application development. In this code, the random module from the Python Standard Library is used.
## Documentation
The official documentation for Python can be found at Python.org and the specific documentation for Python 3.11.5 can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/
## Lessons Learned

From this coding exercise, lessons learnt:

1. How to use the random module to generate random choices.
2. The use of lists to store multiple items and how to concatenate lists.
3. The use of the join() method to convert a list into a string.
4. The importance of user input in determining the functionality of a program.
5. How to create a simple yet effective password generator using Python. This can be a good starting point for anyone looking to delve deeper into cybersecurity or data protection.
